## WIN32
* it was only tested with visual studio.

## LINUX
* I am not sure if glew is needed for linux distros.
* Will most likely need you to do some changes to the cmake/code
* don't forget to install sdl before running!    
apt-get install libsdl2-dev    
apt-get install libglew-dev    
apt-get install libassimp3v5
apt-get install libassimp-dev  
apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev    
apt-get install cmake xorg-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libsdl2.0

## OSX
* it wasn't tested on mac, so have fun!
